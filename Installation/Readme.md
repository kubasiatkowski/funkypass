# Installation

The installation is not automated and the software is delivered as is.

If you want to host it yourself you need:
- Azure Functions
- Azure SQL (database schema is in this directory) configured to use Service Managed Identity
- Dictionaries
- Server to host static front end (I'm using Azure Blob Storage)

Feel free to raise an issue if you need a help with installation. I may prepare ARM templates and scripts if needed.
